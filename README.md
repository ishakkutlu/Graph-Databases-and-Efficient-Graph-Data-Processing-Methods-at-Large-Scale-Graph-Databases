Majored on efficient graph data processing methods at large scale graph databases such as path finding and searching, centrality and community (partition or cluster) algorithms as well as recursive traversal, pathing, known walking, generic labels, denormalization, subgraphs and performance optimization techniques by the Gremlin query language. Studied also scalability, native graph processing and index-free adjacency rule-based native graph storage technologies.
